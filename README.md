# ♻️ RecycleRewards: Blockchain-Based Plastic Recycling Incentive System

Welcome to RecycleRewards, a Web3 project that tackles the global plastic waste crisis by incentivizing consumers to recycle through a tokenized reward system. Using smart bins equipped with IoT sensors, users can deposit plastics, get verified recycling events on the Stacks blockchain, and earn fungible tokens that can be redeemed for discounts, products, or even staked for additional benefits. This promotes environmental sustainability while creating a transparent, tamper-proof tracking mechanism.

## ✨ Features

♻️ Track recycling via smart bins with real-time verification  
🏆 Earn RecycleTokens (RT) based on the weight/volume of recycled plastics  
📱 User registration and profile management for tracking personal impact  
🔒 Immutable records of recycling events to prevent fraud  
💰 Redeem tokens with partners (e.g., stores, eco-brands)  
🗳️ Governance for community-driven updates to reward rates  
📊 Analytics for users and operators to view recycling stats  
🚫 Dispute resolution for contested recycling claims  

## 🛠 How It Works

RecycleRewards leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. Smart bins (IoT devices) detect deposits, measure quantities, and submit data to the blockchain via oracles or authorized operators. Users scan a QR code or use an app to link their wallet and claim credit.

**For Consumers (Recyclers)**  
- Register your profile via the UserRegistry contract.  
- Deposit plastics into a registered smart bin.  
- The bin submits a recycling event to the RecyclingTracker contract.  
- Rewards are calculated by the RewardCalculator contract based on predefined rates (e.g., 1 RT per kg of plastic).  
- Claim your tokens through the ClaimRewards contract and transfer them using the RecycleToken contract.  
- Optionally, stake tokens in the StakingPool contract for bonus yields or governance voting power.  

**For Smart Bin Operators**  
- Register your bin via the BinRegistry contract, providing location and verification details.  
- Use authorized keys to submit recycling events, ensuring data integrity.  
- Monitor events and rewards distribution for operational insights.  

**For Verifiers/Partners**  
- Query the RecyclingTracker or UserProfile contracts to verify a user's recycling history.  
- Use the Governance contract to propose changes, like adjusting reward multipliers.  
- Integrate with the RecycleToken contract to accept RT as payment or for redemptions.  

**For Admins/Community**  
- The Governance contract allows token holders to vote on system parameters.  
- Disputes can be handled via the DisputeResolution contract, where evidence is reviewed on-chain.  

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:  

1. **RecycleToken.clar** (SIP-10 Fungible Token): Manages the RT token supply, minting, burning, and transfers.  
2. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles user registration, wallet linking, and profile data (e.g., total recycled amount).  
3. **BinRegistry.clar**: Registers and verifies smart bins, storing metadata like location, owner, and authentication keys.  
4. **RecyclingTracker.clar**: Logs immutable recycling events, including user ID, bin ID, quantity, and timestamp.  
5. **RewardCalculator.clar**: Computes rewards based on event data, applying multipliers or bonuses from governance.  
6. **ClaimRewards.clar**: Allows users to claim pending rewards, minting RT tokens upon verification.  
7. **StakingPool.clar**: Enables staking of RT for yields, with lock-up periods and reward distribution.  
8. **Governance.clar**: Facilitates DAO-like voting on parameters like reward rates, using staked RT for voting power.  
9. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Manages disputes over recycling claims, with escrow for contested rewards and resolution voting.  

These contracts interact seamlessly: e.g., a recycling event in RecyclingTracker triggers RewardCalculator, which queues claims in ClaimRewards.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Development**: Clone the repo, install Clarity tools, and deploy contracts to Stacks testnet.  
- **Integration**: Build a frontend app for user interactions and an API for smart bin data submission.  
- **Real-World Impact**: Partner with municipalities or companies to deploy smart bins, turning plastic waste into a rewarded habit!
